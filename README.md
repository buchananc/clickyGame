# Clicky Game
Clicky Game is a memory game created with React. UI is broken up into components, component states are managed and respond to user events. 

## How it Works
Different images should render to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The user's score will be kept and will increment when clicking an image for the first time. Your score will reset to 0 if you click the same image more than once.

<br/>
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves to a new random order.

<br/>
Once your score resets after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
